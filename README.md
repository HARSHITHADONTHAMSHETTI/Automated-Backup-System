# Automated-Backup-System
The Automated Backup System is a Java-based tool that automates the backup of important files at scheduled intervals. Users can select folders to back up, and the system creates periodic backups in compressed .zip format to save space. Backup activities are logged for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
